# MirathXRabat
MirathXRabat is a mobile AR game prototype set in Rabat, with the Chellah chapter as the first developed site for the World Heritage Volunteers Initiative 2025. Players engage with gamified XR activities that provide interactive learning and highlight the historical and cultural significance of Rabat’s heritage.
