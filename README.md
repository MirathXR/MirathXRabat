# MirathXRabat

MirathXRabat is a site-specific mobile XR prototype built around the city of Rabat, a world hertige UNESCO site in Morocco. For the World Heritage Volunteers 2025 (WHV25) - _Patrimoine phygital : Chellah & Oudayas entre virtuel et gamification_ initiative, a pilot chapter built around the archeological site of Chellah has been developped.
The prototype explores how location-based AR, lightweight interactions, and digital storytelling can support new forms of cultural built heritage education and public engagement.

## Overview 
MirathXRabat provides an immersive, chapter-based experience where players move through Rabat heritage locations and unlock XR activities that reveal architectural and urban layers of the site.
This early prototype focuses on:
- Geolocated AR activations around Chellah.
- Simple interactive collectibles and minigames.
- Modular architecture for extending the project to other sites.
- A rapid-deployment Unity structure suitable for workshops, teaching, and research.

The project aims to prototype accessible workflows for digital built heritage, XR pedagogy, and public outreach.
